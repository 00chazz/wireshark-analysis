# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Wireshark, a powerful network packet analyzer, to capture and analyze various types of network traffic. The aim is to understand network behavior, troubleshoot network problems, and gain insights into network security and performance based on real traffic scenarios.

## Environments and Technologies Used
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer
- **Operating Systems Used**:
  - Windows 10
- **Network Protocols Analyzed**:
  - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
  - SSH (Secure Shell)
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
  - DNS (Domain Name System)
  - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

## High-Level Analysis Steps
1. **Setup Wireshark on Windows 10**:
   - Install Wireshark and configure it to capture traffic on a designated network interface.
2. **Capture Network Traffic**:
   - Perform captures for different types of network traffic, including ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP.
3. **Analyze Captured Traffic**:
   - Examine the details of each protocol's operation and behavior under various conditions.

## Detailed Analysis and Configuration Steps
